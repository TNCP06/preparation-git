* Create a new branch, then checkout to the new branch that has been created. Use `git checkout -b <branch_name>` or `git branch <branch_name>` then follow by `git switch <branch_name>`.

* Then, commit the file1 and file2 in the first commit, then commit file3 in the second commit. First of all move the file into staging area use `git add <file_name>`, after that you can commit the change using `git commit -m "commit message"`
* So in the end we will have 2 commit, 1 commit for file1 and file2, 1 commit for file3
* Push the commit into your branch using `git push -u origin <branch_name>`
* Check the repository in the github, then choose compare pull & request. If you encounter a compare and pull request button doesn't appear. Ask the mentor immediately.
* Fill the some details in the pull & request section then finish it!
